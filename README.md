# Webster Image Editor

Webster Image Editor is a web-based application built using the HTML canvas element. It provides a versatile platform for creating and editing images by utilizing layers. Each figure, image, textbox, or drawing is treated as a separate layer, which can be manipulated individually or collectively. All layers are successively applied to a canvas, resulting in a final composition.

## Key Features

- Create compositions with custom sizes to suit your requirements.
- Upload images from your device or choose from our selection of presets.
- Add text to images with options to customize style, color, alignment, and position.
- Draw simple figures such as squares, circles, regular polygons, and stars.
- Rotate and scale layers and the entire composition.
- Apply various filters to enhance or modify the appearance of the image.
- Sort layers by moving them up or down in the layer stack.
- Delete unnecessary layers to refine your composition.
